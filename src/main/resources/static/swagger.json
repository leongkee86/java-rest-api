{"openapi":"3.0.1","info":{"title":"Server APIs (Java + MongoDB)","description":"## Hi. I am Lim Leong Kee.\n\nI have developed the entire set of server-side APIs using **Java**, with **MongoDB** as the underlying database. These APIs are fully documented and available for exploration and interaction via this page.\n\nOnce you have registered and logged in to your account, you will be able to:\n\n  - 🎮 Play games: 1. Guess Number | 2. Arrange Numbers | 3. Rock Paper Scissors (Practice and Challenge modes)\n\n  - 👤 View your game profile or another user's game profile\n\n  - 🏆 Check the leaderboard\n\n> All API endpoints are interactive and can be tested directly using the **\"Try it out\"** button located to the right of each endpoint on this page!\n\nAdditionally, I customized this Swagger UI by integrating my own **HTML** and **JavaScript** files to provide the following features:\n\n  1. 🔐 **Automatic JWT Handling:** Automatically captures the JWT token upon successful login and injects it into all requests targeting protected endpoints.\n\n  2. 🚪 **Logout Behavior:** Clears the JWT token upon logout to prevent access to protected endpoints until the user logs in again.\n\n  3. 🧩 **Custom Operation Sorting:** API operations are sorted using a custom logic for a cleaner, more intuitive navigation experience.\n\nI would sincerely appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or improvements you might have. Thank you for taking the time to review my work.\n","contact":{"name":"Lim Leong Kee","email":"leongkee86@gmail.com"},"version":"0.0.2"},"servers":[{"url":"https://leongkee-java-rest-api.onrender.com","description":""}],"tags":[{"name":"Auth"},{"name":"Game"}],"paths":{"/api/game/rockPaperScissors/practise":{"post":{"tags":["Game"],"summary":"Practise the Rock Paper Scissors game for fun.","description":"Practise the Rock Paper Scissors game for fun.
